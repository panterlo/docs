Our API endpoint for financial and annual reports has been built to simplify for any
developer working with either charts or sheet like data. The annual reports contains
the result- and balancesheet, key metrics, footnotes and any additional information.

## Schema description

Each record contains an order which means which row you should display the data at, think
like an Excel sheet. The localized field name contains a description in the given language.
The display format can be used to simplify the presentation by using the format for almost any
given number and formatting library.

Notes and highlight are specifically if you want to highlight data with color and
a note describing something. If something needs highlighting our API will
output it so it's easy for you to use.

```json Schema for a record
{
  "order": 123,
  "localizedFieldName": "<string>",
  "enFieldName": "<string>",
  "displayFormat": "<string>",
  "type": "<string>",
  "value": "<any>",
  "notes": "<string>",
  "highlight": "green"
}
```
