# Search

TIC provides an easy to use search API based on [Typesense](https://typesense.org) lightning-fast search database.

Check out examples and [documentation here](/api-core/search).

## Accounts

An account groups togheter companies and persons and could technically be called a list. Each account could
contain one or multiple users having access to the account.

Accounts are a great way to:

- Group togheter vendors
- Group togheter customers
- Group togheter various lists of companies that you want to track

Each account could reference one or multiple companies and/or persons. An account could also contain
a webhook to post event changes to the companies and/or persons in the account.

## Companies

Each company contains a large number of current and historic records. Each stored in different entities and
urls. When you search you will get an aggregate of certain records that are used for search purposes. but
to get access to all historic records you need to access each endpoint.

Changes in for example in a company purpose is recorded under
https://api.tic.io/datasets/companies/{companyId}/purpose with details when it was changed.
