### Details

This will return the report in a XHTML (iXBRL) format inline with the browser.
To force a download you can use querystring inline=false.

Please note that if no iXBRL document is available you will get 404 - Not found.

iXBRL is a format that combines tradional HTML with XML elements from the XBRL standard.
It works fine for user experiences where you don't want a PDF viewer to open.

You can also use this document if you want to provide your own processing of the
financial data.
