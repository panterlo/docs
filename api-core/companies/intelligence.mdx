### Details

This endpoint will return all historical and current intelligence records for a business. Intelligence records are part of
our [AI Anomaly Detection](/technology/ai-anomaly-detection) which highlights discrepancies in data and their significance.

## Intelligence types

Intelligence records contains information about various discrepancies that we find in data. A record contains a score between 0 and 255
representing the significance of the discrepancy. If the score equals 0 is means it's just for information while 255 means the discrepancy
is very significant. Each intelligence record also comes with a human English text describing the discrepancy called intelligence.notes.

List of intelligence.companyIntelligenceType below in the table. Please note that while searching you need to enter the value (Int32) and not the name itself. Value
2,4 and 6 are unused currentley. They may appear in search result currentley just for testing.

| Enum                         | Value | Description                                                |

The intelligence.externalId is used to reference an id containing the orgin of the intelligence record. If for example the
intelligence record is of type: AnnualReportDiscrepancies (8) it means the external id represents the id of the annual report.

Certain intelligence types have subtypes to further describe what has been found. The intelligence.companyIntelligenceSubType is
an enum text to make it easier to filter based on search.
