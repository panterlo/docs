title: 'Throttling'
description: 'Blocks excessive usage and abuse'
---

Our API has been built for easy to use, fast response times and efficient use of memory databases.
But we will still have a throttling system in place to block excessive usage and abuse.
The throttling is configured per API key and when new keys are generated the throttling policy is set to a default.

## Default throttling policy

The throttling policy consists of permit limit, sliding window and concurrency limit.

### Permit Limit

This contains the number of requests that can happen within a certain timeframe.

### Sliding Window

This contains the time frame for which the requests are counted for.
Sliding means is tracks requests in the recent past to allow for certain spikes in the traffic.

### Concurrency Limit

This contains the maximum number of requests.

### Default values

The default values for permit limit is 2 requests per second.
