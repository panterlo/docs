<Tip>
  We are currentley under an application process as an licenced credit reference
  agency and that means that our API is restricted to few endpoints. We don't
  expose our anomaly, intelligence or credit scoring features.

The Intelligence Company AB (publ), TIC, is a credit reference agency that gathers and process information from
a large number of sources and builds trusted risk models, apply credit scoring and carry out continous credit
assesment on companies and individuals.

Our datasets are also used for prospecting and keeping registry information up-to-date. Our technology is
based mostly on AI anomaly detection and an [AI based intelligence document processing](/api-idp/introduction), IDP, engine.

## AI Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)

Our AI based intelligence document processing, IDP, engine collects information from documents
and turns them into valuable insights.

It's used by us to create valuable datasets but you can also use the same set of API to extract meaningful
information from unstructured data for your own documents.
