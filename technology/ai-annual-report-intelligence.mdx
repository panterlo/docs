---

Credit reference agencies gives lenders and and others a range of information about the
pontential borrower, customer or vendor. A signifcant part of this information is based
on annual reports and other financial statements belonging to the business.

The same set of financial data is also exposed in business information services provided
by a large number of actors in the market.

In countries such as Sweden the statutory audit requirements for companies was abolished in 2010
which since then allows businesses under certain size to reduce administrative burden by not having
an auditor. This has created new challenges which has remained unsolved by our competitors. Companies
can submit financial statements and annual reports that contains forged financial data and authorities
have very little to no possibility to detect these.

The Swedish National Audit Office, NAO, wrote in the [report 12 december 2017 - Abolition of audit obligation for small limited companies](https://www.riksrevisionen.se/download/18.26c2548c1616574394b157/1518435480894/RiR_2017_35_REVISIONSPLIKT_SUMMARY.PDF):

_One consequence is that the registered annual reports risk containing incorrect totals, which contravenes
the requirement that annual reports must give a true and fair view of the companiesâ€™ finances.
The deficient annual reports are passed on unchanged to various stakeholders, such as other authorities in
criminal investigations and credit rating companies, which risk making assessments on incorrect grounds.
For example, a company can record incorrect financial information in the balance or income statement to
present the company's finances as better or worse._

## Solution

Togheter with [AI intelligent document processing, IDP](/technology/ai-intelligent-document-processing), we detect a large number of discrepancies in
annual reports such as these examples:

- Similarities in annual reports based on historic annual reports for all businesses, e.g has the
  annual report been copied from another business or part of the data been modified
- Summary errors
- Unrestricted equity doesn't balance between the years
- The annual report doesn't adhere to requirement per local regulations for example in Sweden Annual Accounts Act
  according to K2 (BFNAR 2016:10) / K3 (BFNAR 2012:1)
- Visually aligning with known accounting systems that typically produce annual reports

These discrepancies are registered on each document with links to which similarities exists
with other documents. The discrepancies are summed up and expressed in words what is wrong
with a score discrepancy ranking between 0-255 where 0 means just a note while 255 means something
very a significant discrepancy.

## Example

A business with an auditor submits an annual report for the year ending 2020-12-31. The following
year another business without an auditor submits a copy of the same annual report
but the multi-year overview is wrong and one of the digits in the organizational number has been
removed.

Visually compairing the result sheet for both businesses you can notice that the rows and amounts are
the same with the difference for the year.

Visually compairing the balance sheet for both businesses you can notice that the rows and amounts are
the same with the difference for the year.

The business that made a copy of the annual report report has also copied the overview with the
other business change of equity. The following image shows that the outgoing balance should be 372,707 SEK
in unrestricted equity.

  alt='change of equity'
/>

The following year the summary with change of equity doesn't match with the prior year. For the year
ending 2022-12-31 the business reports that the ingoing unstricted equity balance is 1,245,154 SEK
while the prior year had an outgoing balance of 372,707 SEK. There are no remarks regarding
the changes of the unrestricted equity.

In the balance sheet of the business it's reporting a change in credit facility debt of 1,467,157 SEK.

## How common are financial statement frauds

We have learned by looking at discrepancies for the last ten years that financial statement frauds are
more common in businesses that has no auditor but they do exist in both. It's easy to create a new
business, submit a fradulent financial report with good looking numbers and get a descent credit score
ranking by existing credit reference agencies. The companies may then be used to receive contributions
and borrow money and then eventually they go bankrupt.

Often we see networks of companies using the same set of financial records but with no links between
the company representatives. They exist in various industries and cities.

This anonymized example shows a small portion of a network of such companies where eight businesses uses
two set of different financial reports but there are no links between the yellow company representatives.
These companies could ultimatley be controlled by other individuals.
