## Unix time only

Typesense only allows unix timestamps to be indexed so search will only present time by the number of non-leap seconds that have elapsed
since 00:00:00 UTC on 1st January 1970, the Unix epoch.

## European Commission and participant status

ecParticipant.validationStatus can contain the following statuses:

**Declared**
Organisation registered by self-registrant. Will remain in this status if the validation is done decentrally by the National Agency.

**Validated**
Organisation validated centrally by REA (Research Executive Agency).

**Suspended**
The legal entity is "frozen" because of an external reason (Bankruptcy, etc.) as a result of central validation by REA (Research Executive Agency).

**Sleeping**
Some data was passed, but the contact person does not react on any demands from the REA (Research Executive Agency) validation team.

**Deprecated**
When duplication is identified by REA (Research Executive Agency), the validity will be Deprecated and the master PIC will be associated. Will not be published in the search.

**Blocked**
Blocked during the validation process by REA (Research Executive Agency).

## Intelligence types

Intelligence records contains information about various discrepancies that we find in data. A record contains a score between 0 and 255
representing the significance of the discrepancy. If the score equals 0 is means it's just for information while 255 means the discrepancy
is very significant. Each intelligence record also comes with a human English text describing the discrepancy called intelligence.notes.

List of intelligence.companyIntelligenceType below in the table. Please note that while searching you need to enter the value (Int32) and not the name itself. Value
2,4 and 6 are unused currently. They may appear in search result currently just for testing.

| Enum                         | Value | Description                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| CreatedAsShelfCompany        | 0     | The company was created as shelf company                   |
| SuspectedForQuickLiquidation | 1     | The company was seems to be going into "quick liquidation" |
| AffliatedWithArticle         | 3     | The company is affiliated with one or multiple articles    |
| SuspectedAddress             | 5     | The address has earlier been known                         |
| PresentOnWarningList         | 7     | The company is present on certain warning lists            |
| AnnualReportDiscrepancies    | 8     | One or multiple annual reports contains discrepancies      |

The intelligence.externalId is used to reference an id containing the orgin of the intelligence record. If for example the
intelligence record is of type: AnnualReportDiscrepancies (8) it means the external id represents the id of the annual report.

## Intelligence subtypes

Certain intelligence types have subtypes to further describe what has been found. The intelligence.companyIntelligenceSubType is
an enum text to make it easier to filter based on search.

List of subtypes. Please note you need to filter by string when using intelligence.companyIntelligenceSubType.

key=your_api_key
```

### Search for companies within a certain geographic area

q=*&
query_by=addresses.street&
filter_by=addresses.location:(57.6799,12.09162, 0.300 km)&

key=your_api_key
```

### Filter for a specific companyId

Filters allows you to narrow down your search. This example shows how to specifically match only the company with id 3508351.
Read more about filters [here](https://typesense.org/docs/26.0/api/search.html#filter-parameters).

```bash cURL

key=your_api_key
```

### Search for companies with specific industry names or codes

can search either for the name as described in the standard or the code itself.

```bash cURL
curl https://api.tic.io/search/companies?
q=Handel%20med%20personbilar%20och%20l%C3%A4tta%20motorfordon&
query_by=sniCodes.sni_2007Name&

q=*&
query_by=registrationNumber&
filter_by=intelligence.companyIntelligenceSubType:['MISSING_AUDITOR']&&
intelligence.score:>254
key=your_api_key
```

### Multi search

Multi search enables you to carry out multi searches in one request by posting a json model to the search endpoint. Typesense have a description of the feature in their [documentation](https://typesense.org/docs/26.0/api/federated-multi-search.html).

Here is an example of how to use multisearch while searching for a company registration number, e-mail, stock ticker and LEI code.

```bash cURL
curl  \
--request POST
--header "Content-Type: application/json"
--header "x-api-key:your_api_key"
--data '{
  "searches": [
    {
      "collection": "companies",
      "query_by": "registrationNumber",
      "q": "5565199493"
    },
    {
      "collection": "companies",
      "query_by": "emailAddresses.emailAddress",
      "q": "kundtjanst@tibroenergi.se"
    },
    {
      "collection": "companies",
      "query_by": "stock.ticker",
      "q": "SBB"
    },
     {
      "collection": "companies",
      "query_by": "lei.leiCode",
      "q": "549300YECS8HKCIMMB67"
    }
  ]
}'
https://api.tic.io/search/companies
```

### Response model

The search response for example when you search for our company would look like the example below for our company.

<Note>
  The registrationDate is in Unix epoch seconds e.g the number of seconds that
  have elapsed since January 1, 1970 (midnight UTC/GMT). Same applies for
  various dates since Typesense requires dates to be serialized to epoch. For
  example listingDate (stock) and nextRenewalDate (lei) are both epoch.
