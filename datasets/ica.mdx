title: 'ICA'
description: 'A dataset to retrive various information from ICA Swedens leading grocery retailer'
---

With some 1,300 stores and a market share of approximately 36%, ICA Sweden is the leading grocery retailer in Sweden. Easy store
is run as a separate entity, business, and it has been hard to track the performance for each store earlier since the store
name typically is very different from the marketed name.

This dataset has been tracking the ICA stores since 2000. An example how the data can be used is demonstrated on [https://ica.jensnylander.com](https://ica.jensnylander.com/)

- Simple to use statistics endpoints
