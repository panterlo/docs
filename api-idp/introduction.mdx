---

Our AI based intelligent document processing API is used to process documents and extract
meaningful data that you can use to create your own datasets. It's used by us to process
both financial and annual reports that companies are submitting to registration authorities.

Folders are used to group documents togheter that can be optionally linked to a company. Our API
contains public folders that are accessible by all users and private folders that belongs
to one or more users.

All folders that you create is private.

## Folders

Use folders to group documents togheter. Each folder belongs to an account and could contain one or many
files.

Creating a folder is simple:

## Supported formats

Our IDP can process the following formats:

- PDF
- TIFF including multi-page TIFF
- PNG

We recommend minimum resolution of 300 dpi.

## Preprocessing

Our API will take care of preprocessing the documents and their images while maintaining the source resolution.

Summary of supported processing events:

- Rotate if needed
- Deskew pages
- Remove punch holes
- Remove border lines
- Adjust for page margins
- Remove page artifacts (arises from scanners and smudges)
- Enhance text

## Documents

You can list, delete, upload and download documents. Each document can be associated with a company. When you upload
a document you can pick four different tranformations:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title='transformToEntity' icon='file-excel'>
    This will transform each page in the file to a set of understandable
    structured entities in JSON format. Think like an Excel sheet. You will get
    each data in columns and rows. It deals with the complexity around
    borderless and bordered tables.
  </Card>
  <Card title='transformToSearchablePDF' icon='file-pdf'>
    This will transform the source file to a searchable visually pleasing PDF
    adhering to PDF version 1.4.
  </Card>
  <Card title='transformToOCR' icon='file-import'>
    An hOCR result will be provided than be used to feed a search database that
    contains the location of text boxes and the contents of the text box.
  </Card>
  <Card title='transformToMetadata' icon='book'>
    An json file will be provided containing the orginal metadata of the file.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How to upload a file

To upload a file you use a multipart form post as the following simple cURL shows:

```bash cURL
curl  \
--request POST \
--header "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
--header "x-api-key:your_api_key" \
--form DocumentTransformType=" \
      transformToEntity, \
      transformToSearchablePDF, \
      transformToOCR" \
--form DocumentType=annualReport \
--form MimeType="application/pdf" \
--form Description="Account Report 2022-03" \
--form ExternalId1=123456 \
--form CompanyId=2692467 \
--form file="@2692467_202104_202203.pdf" \
https://api.tic.io/folders/1/documents
```

You will receive the stored document id and the status of the transformation. Currentley you need to manually
check back for the result. A webhook feature is planned to get the status posted back.

```json Response

  "documentId": 1068,
